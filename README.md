# Web Scraper

This Python script is a simple web scraper designed to extract various types of content from a given webpage and save it to a CSV file. The script uses the `requests` library to fetch the webpage and `BeautifulSoup` from the `bs4` library to parse the HTML content.


## Video Demo

Watch the video below to see a demonstration of how the web scraper works:

## Features

- Fetches webpage content based on user-provided URL.
- Extracts and saves the following elements from the webpage:
  - Headers (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`)
  - Paragraphs (`p`)
  - Lists (`ul`, `ol`, `li`)
  - Meta tags (`title`, `meta`)
  - Links (`a`)
  - Table contents (`tr`, `th`, `td`)
  - Form elements (`input`, `textarea`, `select`, `option`)
  - Media elements (`img`, `video`, `source`, `audio`)
- Handles network errors gracefully with appropriate logging.
- Saves the extracted content to a CSV file (`data.csv`).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `beautifulsoup4` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the script by executable file:
    ```Exe
    Web_Sraper.exe
    ```
2. Enter the URL you want to scrape when prompted:
    ```plaintext
    Enter the URL to scrape: https://example.com
    ```
3. The script will attempt to fetch the webpage and scrape the content.
4. If successful, the extracted content will be saved to `data.csv` in the same directory as the script.
5. If there is an error, it will be logged, and an exception will be raised.
